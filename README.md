# There are seven common steps to deploy your ML model 
  - This is my very first `classification` ML Model.

### 0. Preprocess + EDA + Feature Selection
  - Preprocess = Prepare data for algorithem (Remove missing values, outliers, reduce number of columns)
  - EDA = Exploratory data analysis (Plot graphs to understand the hidden data patterns)
  - Feature selection = Select features/columns (Remove unnessesory columns)
### 1. Extract input and output columns
### 2. Scale the values 
### 3. Train - Test - Split
  - Split your data in two parts (8:2) -
    - Training Data Set - 80% - (To train the model)
    - Testing Data Set - 20% - (To evaluate the model)
### 4. Train the model
### 5. Evaluate the model/model selection
### 6. Deploy the model
